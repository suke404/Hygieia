##How we build the project: 
using Flutter with Dart

##The challenges we faced: 
we were all new to Flutter and Dart, and we are all new to Hackathon with no previous experience, so we are all learning when we are creating our project.

##Reflection
I am really glad that I have the such amazing opportunity to attend the DeltaHack, it is really a fun journey where I learn and meet new friends along this 1 and a half day.
Staying night to learn and work with flutter using Dart is probably the most horrifying thing during the process. 
I am completely new to flutter and Dart, and Dart is somewhat completely different wtih all the languages I learned.
I am definitely looking forward to attend another hackathon, since it is really fun and meaningful.
